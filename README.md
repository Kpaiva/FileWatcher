# FileWatcher
A simple File Watcher program written in VB.Net. 

As it is the program will check the hash of a file given to it (currently full path because i didn't need mre than that when i wrote it) and then it will send an email to the provided recipients currently hard coded when the file has a different hash. In other words when the file changes.

Project was created in VS2012 and the project opened in VS2013.
